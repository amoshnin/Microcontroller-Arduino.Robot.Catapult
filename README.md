# Microcontroller Arduino Project of a Catapult Robot

This repository houses the code for my Arduino Microcontroller Project featuring a catapult robot designed to navigate through a challenging obstacle course. Once it successfully traverses the obstacles, the robot is programmed to launch a catapult ball over a tall barrier. The construction of the robot involves a cardboard body, plastic wheels, a motor, and an Arduino microcontroller board.
