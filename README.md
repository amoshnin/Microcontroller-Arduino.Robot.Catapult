# Microcontroller Arduino Project of a Catapult Robot

This repository houses the code for my Arduino-based Microcontroller Project, featuring a catapult robot designed to navigate through a challenging obstacle course. The robot's mission is to successfully surmount a sequence of obstacles before ultimately launching a catapult ball over a tall barrier. The construction materials for the robot include a cardboard body, plastic wheels, a motor, and an Arduino microcontroller board.
